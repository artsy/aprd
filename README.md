# APRd (Artsy Real-time Dashboard) [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/artsy/aprd.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/artsy/aprd)

APRd (aka. APR dashboard), is a real-time dashboard built in [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) on [Phoenix Framework](https://phoenixframework.org/). For it's real-time dashboard it's using [Phoenix Live View](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view) to be able to provide websocket based pages that can update in real-time based on updates on the server side.

## Meta

## Setup

- Fork the project to your GitHub account

- Clone your fork:
  ```
  $ git clone git@github.com:your-github-username/apr-dashboard.git
  ```
- Ensure you have [postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) and [rabbitmq](https://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html) installed
- Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
- Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
- Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
- We use [Phoenix Live View](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view) for our real-time data presentation. Make sure to set `SECRET_SALT` in your `.env`. Generate a secret salt with:
  - `mix phx.gen.secret 32`
- Make set your RabbitMQ setting in `.env`
- Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000/dashboard`](http://localhost:4000/dashboard) from your browser.

## Architecture

APRd listens on RabbitMQ for different topics. Once it receives a new event, it will store a copy of that event locally in it's database so we can later process the data and provide detailed and aggregated data.

Whenever we receive a new event, after storing the event locally, we use Phoenix's local PUB/SUB to broadcast we received an event. And then our websocket live views are listening on this internal PUB/SUB and they update the data on listening Webosckets reflecting the latest event updated.

## Artsy Slack Setup

APRd is used to power critical alerting workflows in Artsy's Slack organization. After a recent incident where APRd lost its connection to Artsy's Slack, we surfaced the following steps to re-connect the digital assets needed to get it all working:

1. Re-enable the `/apr` slash command: https://artsy.slack.com/services/B227A48KX
1. Re-enable the `@apr / APR Announcer` Slack bot: https://artsy.slack.com/services/70260076245
1. Re-invite the Bot in (2) to the appropriate Slack channels
    - You can check your work by reading the Channels attribute on the Bot show page: https://artsy.slack.com/services/70260076245
1. Re-generate the bot API token (via https://artsy.slack.com/services/70260076245)
1. Run `hokusai [staging|production] env set SLACK_API_TOKEN=token-from-step-4`
1. Run `hokusai [staging|production] refresh`
